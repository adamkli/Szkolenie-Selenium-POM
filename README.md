This repository contains code utilized for a training session on Selenium and the Page Object Model (POM). The code is written in C# and uses NUnit for testing. It features a base class called TestWith<TPage>, which facilitates the addition of tests to previously created POM classes.

The tests are executed on the pages of the website http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/, which is publicly available for testing purposes.
